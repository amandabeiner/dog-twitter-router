# Dog Twitter Router

A live-coded presentation of React Router. The app renders a root route with a `TwitterFeed` component and a `/mypage` route that is specific to the user.

The `MyPage` component has a form that allows the user to add a tweet. Adding a tweet should live-update the `MyFeed` component to include the new tweet.

## Setup
To get set up, run the following:
```no-highlight
  bundle
  ruby server.rb
```

In a new terminal tab, run:
```no-highlight
  npm install
  npm start
```

And navigate to `localhost:4567`
